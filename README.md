# World-Football-Leagues-Dashboard

#### ðŸ‘‰The idea behind this project was motivated by my love for football and curiosity for stats. This project uses RESTful API provided by [Football Data](https://www.football-data.org/) which provides football data and statistics (live scores, fixtures, tables, squads, lineups/subs, etc.) in a machine-readable way.<br>


#### ðŸ‘‰This project gets updated regularly. So feel free to contribute or suggest any improvisation/changes!<br><br>

#### ðŸ‘‰To run this web app locally: 

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```
